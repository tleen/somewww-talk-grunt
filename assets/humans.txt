Why
---

I have been using Grunt for awhile, but always learned just enough of it to get by. This talk was a way for me to learn more about Grunt and introduce it to others as well.


Technologies
------------

The [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) server environment for project builds.
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as the build tool and **topic**. 
[Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) is for html and templating. 
I am handing CSS using [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).
The [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js) presentation framework is a basis for the slides/UI.
The site is hosted on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
